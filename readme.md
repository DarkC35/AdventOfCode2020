These are my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2020** mainly written in Python. 

## About Advent of Code

> This is a short version of the about page. See the official about page here: https://adventofcode.com/2020/about

**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

**Advent of Code is a registered trademark in the United States.**
